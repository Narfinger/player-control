# player-control
A Simple HTTP Interface to control serieviewer and clementine-player.

This is a programm that controls serieviewer and clementine-player per web interface.
It is written in different languages (mostly because I use this for learning new languages.
It can happen that I lose interest in the other language working ones if I have a shiny new one I am working on.

At the time of writing the haskell one is the newest but check the dates in the history to be sure.
